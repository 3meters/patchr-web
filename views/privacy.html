                                in to their service. Some apps may share your Personal Information, activities
                                and/or content with Teeny Social. Please read the privacy policy of any such
                                app so that you understand its sharing practices.

                        <p>
                            Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your
                            information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to
                            update it quickly or to delete it â€“ unless we have to keep that information
                            for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal
                            information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on
                            your request.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate
                            technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally
                            changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be
                            extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing
                            on backup tapes).

                        <p>
                            Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so
                            for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim
                            to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental
                            or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information
                            from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our
                            active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

                            Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Service
                            or sending you an email. Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy
                            Policy when they use the Service after such changes have been first posted.
