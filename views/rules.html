                            Our goal is to provide a service that lets you communicate and share just enough with the important
                            people in your life. We respect the ownership of the content that users share and each user
                            is responsible for the content he or she provides. Because of these principles,
                            we do not actively monitor and will not censor user content, except in
                            limited circumstances described below.

                            share content with others, there are some limitations on the type of content
                            that can be published with Teeny Social. These limitations comply with legal
                            requirements and make Teeny Social a better experience for all. We may need
                            to change these rules from time to time and reserve the right to do so.
